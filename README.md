# 🚀 Emotion Detection Application

This project is an **Emotion Detection** application that uses embeddable AI libraries to analyze text and determine the dominant emotion. The application is packaged, tested, and deployed on the web using Flask.

---

## ✨ Features
- 🧠 Detects five primary emotions in text: `anger`, `disgust`, `fear`, `joy`, and `sadness`.
- 🎯 Identifies the dominant emotion based on the highest score.
- 🌐 Provides an API endpoint for emotion analysis.
- ✅ Handles error cases for invalid or blank input.
- 📏 Fully compliant with Python's PEP8 standards (10/10 PyLint score).

---

## 🛠️ **How It Works**
1. Users submit text to the `/emotionDetector` API endpoint.
2. The application processes the text using the `EmotionDetection` library.
3. The system returns emotion scores and the dominant emotion in a formatted response.
4. Handles blank or invalid inputs gracefully.

---

## 🌟 **API Endpoint**
### `/emotionDetector`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Input:** JSON payload with the key `text`
    ```json
    {
      "text": "I love programming!"
    }
    ```
- **Output:**
    ```json
    {
        "anger": 0.01,
        "disgust": 0.02,
        "fear": 0.03,
        "joy": 0.95,
        "sadness": 0.04,
        "dominant_emotion": "joy"
    }
    ```

- **Error Handling:**
    - For blank input:
        ```json
        {
          "error": "Invalid text! Please try again!"
        }
        ```

## ⚙️ **Setup Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dsubject/oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai.git
    cd oaqjp-final-project-emb-ai/final_project
    ```
2. Install required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python3.11 server.py
    ```
4. Access the application at [http://localhost:5000/emotionDetector](http://localhost:5000/emotionDetector).

---

## 🧪 **Testing**
Unit tests are provided to validate the functionality of the emotion detection system:
1. Run the tests:
    ```bash
    python3.11 -m unittest test_emotion_detection.py
    ```
2. Verify all tests pass. ✅

---

## 📊 **Static Code Analysis**
This project follows PEP8 guidelines and achieves a perfect PyLint score:
1. Run PyLint:
    ```bash
    pylint server.py
    ```
2. Ensure a `10/10` score is displayed.

---

## 🌐 **Web Deployment**
The application is deployed locally using Flask. It is accessible at:
- [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Example Usage:
- Input: `I am excited to learn more about AI!`
- Output:
    ```
    For the given statement, the system response is 'anger': ..., 'disgust': ..., 'fear': ..., 'joy': ... and 'sadness': .... The dominant emotion is joy.
    ```

## What I Learned
Working on this project, I gained hands-on experience with:
1. **AI Model Integration**:
    - Learned to work with pre-trained AI models like Watson NLP for natural language processing.
    - Extracted and processed complex JSON responses to create user-friendly outputs.

2. **RESTful API Development**:
    - Designed and deployed an API endpoint using Flask to handle user requests and process responses.

3. **Error Handling**:
    - Implemented error-handling mechanisms to manage blank inputs and edge cases gracefully.

4. **Testing and Debugging**:
    - Wrote and executed unit tests to validate application functionality.
    - Debugged issues and ensured the application met all functional requirements.

5. **Code Quality and Compliance**:
    - Ensured adherence to PEP8 standards, achieving a perfect PyLint score.
    - Wrote clean, maintainable, and modular code.

6. **Web Deployment**:
    - Deployed a Flask application locally and ensured it handled various inputs effectively.

## 🚀 **Future Enhancements**
- ☁️ Deploy the application on cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or Azure).
- 🌍 Add support for additional emotions or languages.
- 🖥️ Provide a web-based interface for easier interaction.
